# Howdy Howdy

This is going to be a page dedicated to an organized list useful links; some of these we may use a lot throughout our project sessions, others not so much. Some links will be for design assets, some dedicated to learning resources and tutorials, and some will be for design inspiration.


## Design Resources
- [Adobe Fonts]
  - A pile of fonts that you can use with Adobe, that you can't really get anywhere else without spending a fortune.
- [Google Fonts]
  - A whole bunch of free-to-use fonts; basically the same ones Canva uses.
- [Envato Elements]
  - Use this for inspiration, templates, mockups, fonts, pretty much anything you need.
- [Coolors.co]
  - Use this for generating color palettes, or to easily generate a reference copy of our brand color palette.
- [Pexels (Free Photography Assets)]
  - A compendium of free photo assets.

## Design Inspiration
- [Behance]
  - This is the site that the majority of designers in the industry use for their design portfolio.

## Design Tutorials
- [Adobe Tutorials]
  - Can't really beat tutorials that come from the people that created the product.
- [Envato Tuts+ Illustrator Tutorial on YouTube]
  - Haven't taken this one, but I watched the intro and it seems to have a good amount of stuff on it. It's 3 1/2 hours of free content!
- [Envato Tuts+ Photoshop Tutorial on YouTube]
  - Haven't taken this one, but I watched the intro and it seems to have a good amount of stuff on it. It's (also) 3 1/2 hours of free content!
