# Howdy Howdy

This is going to be a page dedicated to an organized list useful links; some of these we may use a lot throughout our project sessions, others not so much. Some links will be for design assets, some dedicated to learning resources and tutorials, and some will be for design inspiration.


## Design Resources
- [Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com/)
- [Adobe Fonts](https://fonts.adobe.com/){:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:target="_blank"}
  - A pile of fonts that you can use with Adobe, that you can't really get anywhere else without spending a fortune.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/){:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:target="_blank"}
  - A whole bunch of free-to-use fonts; basically the same ones Canva uses.
- [Envato Elements](https://elements.envato.com/){:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:target="_blank"}
  - Use this for inspiration, templates, mockups, fonts, pretty much anything you need.
- [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/generate/){:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:target="_blank"}
  - Use this for generating color palettes, or to easily generate a reference copy of our brand color palette.
- [Pexels (Free Photography Assets)](https://pexels.com/){:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:target="_blank"}
  - A compendium of free photo assets.

## Design Inspiration
- [Behance](https://behance.net/){:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:target="_blank"}
  - This is the site that the majority of designers in the industry use for their design portfolio.

## Design Tutorials
- [Adobe Tutorials](https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/tutorials-explore.html){:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:target="_blank"}
  - Can't really beat tutorials that come from the people that created the product.
- [Envato Tuts+ Illustrator Tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib8UBwu3yGA){:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:target="_blank"}
  - Haven't taken this one, but I watched the intro and it seems to have a good amount of stuff on it. It's 3 1/2 hours of free content!
- [Envato Tuts+ Photoshop Tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyR_uYsRdPs){:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:target="_blank"}
  - Haven't taken this one, but I watched the intro and it seems to have a good amount of stuff on it. It's (also) 3 1/2 hours of free content!
