## Common Keystroke Commands in Adobe InDesign for Windows and Mac

Adobe InDesign is a powerful design software that is widely used by designers and creatives. To get the most out of InDesign, it's important to be familiar with some of the common keystroke commands. Here are some of the most frequently used keystroke commands for InDesign on Windows and Mac:

### Windows

- `Ctrl + N`: Create a new document
- `Ctrl + O`: Open an existing document
- `Ctrl + S`: Save the current document
- `Ctrl + S`hift + S: Save As
- `Ctrl + W`: Close the current document
- `Ctrl + Z`: Undo the last action
- `Ctrl + S`hift + Z: Redo the last undone action
- `Ctrl + X`: Cut the selected content
- `Ctrl + C`: Copy the selected content
- `Ctrl + V`: Paste the copied or cut content
- `Ctrl + A`: Select all the content in the document

### Mac

- `Cmd + N`: Create a new document
- `Cmd + O`: Open an existing document
- `Cmd + S`: Save the current document
- `Cmd + S`hift + S: Save As
- `Cmd + W`: Close the current document
- `Cmd + Z`: Undo the last action
- `Cmd + S`hift + Z: Redo the last undone action
- `Cmd + X`: Cut the selected content
- `Cmd + C`: Copy the selected content
- `Cmd + V`: Paste the copied or cut content
- `Cmd + A`: Select all the content in the document

## Margins, Columns, Gutters, and Bleeds

### Setting up Margins, Columns, and Gutters

1. Open InDesign and create a new document or open an existing one.
2. Go to the "Layout" menu (at the top of the screen) and select "Margins and Columns".
3. In the "Margins and Columns" dialog box, you can set the margins by inputting values in the "Top", "Bottom", "Left", and "Right" fields.
4. To add columns to your document, enter the number of columns you want in the "Number" field.
5. The "Gutter" field allows you to set the amount of space between each column.
6. Once you've set your margins, columns, and gutters, click "OK" to apply the changes.

### Bleeds in InDesign

Bleeds are used in printing to extend the image or color beyond the edge of the page, ensuring that no white border is left when the page is trimmed to size. Here's how to set up bleeds in InDesign:

1. Go to the "File" menu and select "Document Setup".
2. In the "Document Setup" dialog box, go to the "Bleed and Slug" section.
3. Input the amount of bleed you want in the "Top", "Bottom", "Left", and "Right" fields. This should be a minimum of 0.125 inches.
4. Once you've set your bleeds, click "OK" to apply the changes.

And that's it! You now have the basics down on setting up margins, columns, gutters, and bleeds in Adobe InDesign.


## Unlocking Content On the Page

Sometimes, when you receive a file from another designer, you may find that some elements on the page are locked and you can't edit them. Here's how you can unlock these elements in Adobe InDesign:

1. Open your InDesign file and navigate to the page where the locked elements are located.
2. Select the Direct Selection tool from the toolbar. It looks like a white arrow.
3. Click on the locked element that you want to unlock.
4. Go to the "Object" menu at the top of the screen, then choose "Lock" > "Unlock All on Spread".
5. Alternatively, you can right-click on the locked element and choose "Unlock".
6. In addition, you could click anywhere in the grey area of the spread, and use the keyboard commands `Ctrl + Alt + 2` (on Windows) or `Command + Option + 2` (on Mac).

And that's it! You should now be able to edit the unlocked element.
> **Note:**
> You may need to repeat these steps for each locked element on the page, and/or for each spread in the document.

## Basic Text Editing

Basic text editing in InDesign is an important part of the design process. Whether you're working with a headline, body copy, or other text elements, it's important to be able to make quick and accurate edits. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

### Adding Text Boxes

To create a new text box:
1. Start by selecting the Type tool in one of the following ways:
   - Press `Ctrl + T` (Windows), or `Cmd + T`(Mac)
   - Click the Type tool in the left toolbar
2. Then, click and drag to create a new text box.


### Editing Text

1. Open your InDesign document and either select the text frame you want to edit, or creating a new one.
2. If you need to add new text to the text box, simply click inside the text frame and start typing. If you need to make changes to existing text, select the text you want to edit by clicking and dragging your cursor over it.
3. To change the font, size, or color of your text, use the Character panel (Window > Type & Tables > Character). You can also access these options from the Control Panel at the top of the screen.
4. To adjust the spacing between lines of text, use the Leading field in the Character panel. You can also adjust kerning, or the spacing between individual characters, from this panel.
5. If you need to adjust the alignment of your text, use the Paragraph panel (Window > Type & Tables > Paragraph). You can choose from options like Left Align, Center Align, Right Align, or Justify.
6. If you need to adjust the paragraph spacing, use the Before and After fields in the Paragraph panel. You can also add indents, bullet points, and other formatting options from this panel.
7. When you're finished making your edits, simply save your document as you normally would (File > Save).

## Converting Text to Outlines

In InDesign, converting text to outlines means turning your text into a vector graphic that can no longer be edited as text. This is useful if you're sending a file to someone who doesn't have the same fonts as you or if you need to manipulate the text in ways that are only possible with vector graphics. Here's how to do it:

1. Select the text you want to convert to outlines.
2. Go to Type > Create Outlines (`Ctrl + Shift + O` on Windows, `Cmd + Shift + O` on Mac).

Your text will now appear as a vector graphic that can be manipulated and resized as necessary.
Keep in mind that once you convert text to outlines, it can no longer be edited as text. Make sure you have a backup of your original text if you need to make any changes later on.

## Creating QR Code Objects

1. Go to the Object menu in the top navigation bar and select "Generate QR Code...."
2. In the QR Code dialog box, select the type of QR code you'd like (Hyperlink, Business Card, Email, etc.)
3. Enter the data that you want to encode in the QR code.
4. You can customize the appearance of the QR code by adjusting the options in the dialog box, such as the size, error correction level, and module size.
5. When you are satisfied with the appearance, click the OK button to insert the QR code in the document.
6. You can further customize the QR code by selecting it and using the standard InDesign tools for shaping and formatting, such as color and stroke width.

## Exporting to PDF, Including Document Bleed Settings

Here are the steps to export your designs to PDF, including document bleed settings in InDesign:

1. Open the document you want to export in InDesign.
2. Go to File > Export (or press `Ctrl + E` on Windows, `Cmd + E` on Mac).
3. Choose Adobe PDF (Print) from the format dropdown menu.
4. In the Adobe PDF Export dialog box, go to the Marks and Bleeds tab.
5. Check the Use Document Bleed Settings option.
6. Click the Export button (or press `Enter` on Windows, `Return` on Mac).
7. Save the PDF file to your desired location.
